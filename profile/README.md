<h3 align="center">Software Craftsmanship meets Game Development</h3>

**Garagecraft Games** was founded with a deep-seated belief that creating software is a <a href="https://thorsten.suckow-homberg.de/docs/articles/software-craftsmanship" target="_blank">craft</a>.

This organization is my space to apply years of experience in software design and development to a new passion: <strong>indie game development</strong>. I love exploring the *how* and *why*. Hence, Garagacraft is also an educational project for me.

Welcome to my creative workshop!

## From Bits to Pixels

Every journey has a starting point. Mine was a little warehouse-managing robot in a coding challenge from [Advent of Code 2024, Day 15](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/15). That puzzle was the tipping point that turned a long-brewing fascination into a hands-on mission.

It was a reminder that at the heart of every complex system is a simple, elegant core - the same core that makes a game feel *right*.

**Garagecraft Games** is founded on that principle: building thoughtful, well-crafted interactive experiences from the ground up.

## Follow the Adventure

I believe in sharing the process. Through my **[Devlog](https://garagecraft.games/devlog/)**, I document the challenges behind game development.



Whether you're a player or a developer - or just curious about the process, I'm glad you're here. You can follow my progress across the web:
